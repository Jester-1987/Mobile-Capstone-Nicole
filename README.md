MedSched (pronounced Med Sked) 

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I had worked in a pharmacy. Over time, I saw how some people had difficulty with remembering to take their medication on a regular basis. Some people were just busy and it would slip their mind, others had a complicated cocktail of medications that needed to be taken at different times of day. 

My proposal is an app that lets the user set alarms for themselves or those they care for to remind them to take their medication. Has a calendar to view medication schedule.

Features include: 


•	Alarm set to set dates/times. 
o	The alarm can be set to silent if needed.

•	Medication Checklist
o	User presses button on a checklist to confirm they have taken their medication.
o	Checklist automatically updates at the start of every day.

•	User friendly interface – easy to read text and simple navigation that is simple for anyone to use.

•	Easy to add/remove medications from the list and what time the medication is meant to be taken.
o	Medication names can be typed in or they can take a photo of the prescription label (text recognition possible?).

•	Creates a list that the user can show medical professionals what medications they are on (quick open button from lock screen that can display this info in case of emergency / sends the info to another trusted device through MMS).

•	The app can also give a reminder to the user when their chronic medication supply is low so they can contact their doctor/pharmacy for refills.

•	If the user is far away from home and not due to return for several days and has forgotten to bring their medication with them/run out of medication the app can direct them to nearby pharmacies/doctor’s offices to get a refill.
